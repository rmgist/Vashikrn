# How to Enhance Your Mantra Practice - Achieving Siddhi

Now that you have learned the mantras, I want to add some additional information here that will
really up the effectiveness of these mantras and any mantra practice for that matter. As you saw,
most of the mantras can be recited a few times and some, many more times. When doing so, you
compound the energy upon itself and then it produces results. It’s like a charge builds up and
eventually fires, producing the goal. This is generally how mantras work and often once the
result is achieved, the energy dissipates and that will be the end of the ritual. But what if you
could ALWAYS embody the energy of the mantra? There is a way and It is called Siddhi.
Siddhi, in Sanskrit means “perfection" "accomplishment" and "Attainment" of magical abilities.
When one achieves Siddhi with a particular mantra they acquire the actual energy of that mantra.
So for example, the Main Attraction Seed Mantra is "Kleem". If you recite this 10,000 times in
one sitting, you will have mastered the energy of this mantra and your attraction abilities will be
enhanced and things will come naturally to you. After you achieve Siddhi, you will be
unstoppable, with every recitation of the mantra after Siddhi you are a true and effective
magician. Some schools of thought say that you do not need to do all 10,000 in one sitting but
over 40 days. Follow your intuition on whether you want to do these chants in one sitting or
several.

In saying this, if you want to enhance any of these mantras, I suggest chanting them 1,000 to
10,000 times in one sitting. I know this sounds like a lot, but once you get into the groove with
the mantra the recitation will move very quickly. To keep track of this, I suggest you use Mala
beads. I personally use this brand: https://baalkadmon.com/mala-beads/
It has 108 beads; 108 is a sacred number and common in Hindu chanting. I highly suggest you
chant a mantra at least 108 times a day. With these Mala Beads, it will be easy to keep track. If
you do 10 rounds of 108 recitations, you will be on your way to achieving Siddhi. You can, of
course use any mala beads or create your own.
